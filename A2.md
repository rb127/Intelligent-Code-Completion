# Assignment 2

\*For more artifacts or insight into the decision making process, please see our meeting minutes (linked in README).

## Post-mortem on Assignment 1

### What goals have been achieved?

- The goals in A1 were very process & planning intensive - we wanted to arrive at design decisions and find libraries and we were largely able to do that.
- The most important part of our project was finding a JS code parser that can also handle incomplete code. We struggled to find a parser that worked reliably with incomplete code initially but after a wild goose chase and many others that didn’t work, we found ‘acorn-loose’ which seemed to work reliably with both incomplete and complete code. 
- Testing the library we were using as the parser was of paramount importance. We were able to use the VSCode debugger tool effectively to give the library different types of code & confirm it worked as we wanted.
- The third thing we achieved in A1 was setting out a plan for the flow of control and how we would interact with the user. We arrived at a design decision (the user will provide a .js file and an integer cursor position and we will use this information to parse the code contextually aware of where the cursor is). We also decided that we would provide a list with matching suggestions to the user's output.
- We were also able to plan and concretely layout our milestones and split up tasks as required by the specifications of the stakeholders. However, we found that these initial milestones were very feature-driven (Discussed in next section).

### What goals have been missed, and by how much?

We don’t think we concretely missed any goals but identified a few areas we would have done differently if we had the option to start over.

- As we worked on A2, we realized that our milestones were extremely feature-driven & not process driven. We realised that our milestones were not capturing any groundwork that would have to be done pre-feature implementation and for our project this was a large chunk of work. We also identified that our milestone had no indication of testing. As we worked harder & harder on the groundwork and testing for A2, we realised that our milestones were not capturing the amount of groundwork we had already put in. This feeling was also reinforced by Greg, our client, who pushed us to focus on Test Driven Development (TDD) and have a blueprint of test cases for A2 that would pass at the end of our project. This emphasised that we could have formulated milestones from more of a developer’s perspective rather than our initial approach of being very feature and consumer/client driven.

- During A1, we assumed that we would “pre-parse” the entire program and keep a data-structure with auto-suggestion results pre-formed to improve efficiency during running the program. However, as we began to think deeper about the flow of control and implementation of the program, we realised that this approach would be very resource-intensive and a large portion of the resources used would not even be utilised. To go ahead with this approach, we would basically have to have a preformed list for every reasonable position of the cursor and then just search for the result based on the actual cursor position. We found that this did not make sense and would take a huge amount of time during the initial run. We also realised that our pre-formed list would be rendered useless each time the input JS code was changed so we have now opted for a ‘live-filled’ implementation plan instead.

- Our final area of improvement identified was for the way the user interacts with the program. We planned for user-input using the cursor position given by the user in an integer format. However, as we ourselves used this format for testing, we realized that this is not the best way to expect the user to provide input as it was extremely cumbersome. We decided to switch to a special character that would mimic the cursor and will add a layer of abstraction to our program which will search for the special character in the input and give our ‘backend’ the integer position of the special character.


### Adjustments or decisions need to be made given new project scope and capacity

We still feel we can deliver on the milestones mentioned in A1 largely. However, there has been some re-scoping with how they are structured. The end-goal remains very similar with almost identical features as planned above even though the process of arriving there and the order of priorities may have changed. We underestimated the significance of the groundwork required to start concretely implementing features straightaway in an efficient way. Consulting with our industry partner also made us realise what we should focus on.

**Based on the above, these are our updated proposed milestones:**
- **Milestone 1:** Finding and testing a reliable parser which works with incomplete code and using this to inform a rough implementation plan and control-flow of the program
- **Milestone 2:** Setting up the infrastructure required to enable easy and efficient development (input files, cursor position, testing), agreeing on a acceptance testing suite with our client, having a detailed implementation idea, and implementing the aforementioned testing-suite to have a concrete set of requirements to pass after Milestone 3
- **Milestone 3:** Implement the actual code and pass the tests written in Milestone 2
  * Incomplete/broken code support
  * Autocomplete suggestions sorted by most immediate scope
  * Support for keywords (updated automatically if keywords are added and removed from JavaScript)
  * Tolerant (possibly) string searching of the autocomplete ‘master list’
  * Providing a .js file and with a cursor special character and receiving an output list ordered by scope and relevance


**Individual responsibilities:**

- Rohit: Efficient Traversal of the ESTree returned by parser
- Chinmaya: Find Data structure for tree and store items
- Shahmir: Figure out user input and testing


## Next Steps with sub-tasks prioritized

- **Get the cursor position from caret symbol. *(2 pts)***
  * Acceptance criteria: 
    - Implement function getCursorPosition that returns the character position of the “^” in the file or -1 if not found. 
    - Passes two existing unit tests for getCursorPosition function.
   * Assigned to: Shahmir
   * Due: 14th November
- **Get a reference string (i.e. characters behind the cursor). *(3 pts)***
  * Acceptance criteria: 
    - Implement function getReferenceString that returns the string found immediately preceding the cursor position. Return empty string if white space or other issues are found.
    - Add unit tests
  * Assigned to: Rohit
  * Due: 20th November
- **Parse the input program and return an ES tree. *(1 pts)***
  * Acceptance criteria

  * Due: 12th November
- **Traverse the tree using Acorn walk and dynamically extract relevant variable/method/class names. *(8 pts)***
  * Acceptance criteria: 
    - Use the acorn walk library to traverse the ES Tree starting with the cursor node and working its way up through referenceable scopes.
    - Returns a list containing names of variables, methods, and classes in order of most local scope to the cursor position. 
    - Add unit tests.
  * Assigned to: Collective task (to be pair programmed)
  * Due: 30th November
- **Add support for recommending JavaScript reserved words and built-ins. *(5 pts)***
  * Acceptance Criteria:

    - 1 function that as input an array and returns the array appended with the JS reserved words and built-ins.
  * Assigned to: Shahmir
  * Due: 22th November
- **Perform string matching on the main list with reference string to return suggestions. *(5 pts)***
  * Acceptance Criteria:
    - Perform string matching (using Regex or an external library) using the reference string. Return a list of ordered suggestions 
  * Assigned to: Chinmaya
  * Due: 22th November

The rationale for how these features were prioritized were based on three key metrics: 
- **The dependencies of subtasks in our implementation plan.** Some subtasks block others. Therefore, the blocking subtask will need to be worked on before the blocked subtask. 
- **The value that the feature adds to the final product.**  Some subtasks are stretch goals and not crucial to achieving the MVP that has been outlined to our industry partner. These will be worked on only if the MVP is completed to a satisfactory degree.
- **Effort required to implement the feature (i.e. story points).** Some subtasks require minimal effort and are easy to implement giving us a “quick win.” It makes sense to get these out of the way earlier so that we have more clarity around the subtasks that require more effort. 


## Demonstrated progress towards one or two of your next milestones.

After meeting with Greg, we rescoped our milestones in a way that were more process-driven as opposed to feature-driven as described in our post-mortem.

Greg encouraged our Milestone 2 deliverable to be a set of acceptance tests that act as a blueprint for how our code completion library will handle different cases and what a client can expect from it. Additionally, we devised a detailed implementation plan and added sample code for how we plan the user to provide inuts to the program

As of right now, all of the acceptance tests have been written and are failing (this is intentional). Therefore, Milestone 2 has been achieved.

Our third and final milestone will be the implementation of all the features outlined in our subtasks above so that all of these tests are able to pass. By following this test driven development process, we will know we have achieved milestone 3 at the end of the semester if our our existing set of 14 acceptance tests are passing.
